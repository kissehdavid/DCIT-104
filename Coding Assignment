Coding assignment 1: Write a program to calculate the average of all even numbers 1 and 10000. 

//Using Python for this Assignment

num = int(input("State the number: "))
//the input function was used to request an input from the user. In this case, we will enter 10000.
count = 0
sum = 0

for i in range(1, num + 1):
    if i%2 == 0:
        sum = sum + i
        count = count + 1

average = sum / count
print("The average of all even numbers from 1 to ",num, " is ", average)
//where num = 10000




Coding Assignment 2: Write a program that produces the sum of all prime numbers less than a given number

//Using Python,

num = int(input("State the given number: "))
sum = 0

for i in range(2, num + 1):
    for j in range(2, i):
        if i % j == 0:
            break
    else:
        sum = sum + i
print("The sum of all Prime numbers less than", num, "is", sum)
